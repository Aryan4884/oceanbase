English | [‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](README_CN.md)

**OceanBase Database** is a distributed relational database developed by Ant Group. It operates on a common server cluster and provides high availability and linear scalability through the use of the [Paxos protocol](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf) and a distributed architecture.

## Key Features

- **Transparent Scalability**: An OceanBase cluster can be scaled out to 1,500 nodes, handling petabytes of data and a trillion rows of records.

- **Ultra-fast Performance**: OceanBase is the only distributed database that has achieved record-breaking performance, with 707 million TPC-C transactions per minute and 15.26 million TPC-H queries per hour at 30,000GB.

- **Real-time Operational Analytics**: It offers a unified system for both transactional and real-time operational analytics workloads.

- **Continuous Availability**: OceanBase uses the Paxos Consensus algorithm to achieve Zero RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and less than 8 seconds of RTO (Recovery Time Objective). It supports intra-city and remote disaster recovery, ensuring zero data loss.

- **MySQL Compatible**: OceanBase Database is highly compatible with MySQL, requiring minimal or no modifications for migration.

- **Cost Efficiency**: The cutting-edge compression technology saves 70%-90% of storage costs without compromising performance. The multi-tenancy architecture achieves higher resource utilization.
